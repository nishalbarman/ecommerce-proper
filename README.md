## Overview

This repository is organized as a monorepo using Turborepo for optimized build and caching. The codebase comprises several parts:

- **apps/admin**: Contains the admin dashboard built with React and Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules to ensure code quality. See the [admin README](apps/admin/README.md) for more details.
- **apps/client**: The client-side application built with Next.js. It features components such as [`LoginForm`](apps/client/src/components/Auth/LoginForm.jsx) and [`ProductItem`](apps/client/src/components/ProductItem/ProductItem.jsx) that handle authentication and product display.
- **apps/hooks** and **apps/server**: Provide additional functionalities and backend services.
- **packages**: Reusable libraries such as `custom-click`, `firebase-utils`, `redux`, and `validator`.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Use your preferred package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm):

   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file at the root.
   - For the admin app, ensure that [apps/admin/.env](apps/admin/.env) is properly configured.
   - Similarly, configure other environment files for different apps as needed.

---

## Development

### Running the Apps

- **Admin App**  
  Navigate to the `apps/admin` directory and run the development server (typically using Vite):

  ```sh
  cd apps/admin
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Client App**  
  Navigate to the `apps/client` directory and start the Next.js development server:

  ```sh
  cd apps/client
  npm run dev
  ```

Turborepo can help manage running multiple apps concurrently. Refer to [turbo.json](turbo.json) for configuration details.

---

## Scripts

The root [`package.json`](package.json) includes various scripts to help with building, testing, and managing the monorepo:

- `npm run dev` – Run all development servers.
- `npm run build` – Build all apps and packages.
- `npm run test` – Run unit and integration tests.

Consult the `package.json` for a full list of available scripts.

---

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `test` directory. To run tests, execute:

```sh
npm run test
```

Ensure that each project/app includes its own test suite where applicable.

---

## Deployment

Deployment is configured through [Netlify](netlify.toml) and [Vercel](.vercel/project.json). Before deployment, make sure you have properly set up your environment variables.

- **Netlify**: Follow the instructions in [netlify.toml](netlify.toml) for deployment settings.
- **Vercel**: Use the Vercel CLI or dashboard with the configuration provided in the `.vercel` directory.
